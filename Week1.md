### Coding 
I have never coded, so my classes this semester are entirely new! If anyone has any recommended reading material or resources for a newbie in tech, I'd appreciate it! Right now, I mostly solve problems by watching YouTube videos. The first code I tried was in C ++ (P.S. Downloading Visual Studio and Clang on Mac was a nightmare; it took me two days, and I'm not sure it's installed correctly. Here is my first code in VS: 
```C++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
